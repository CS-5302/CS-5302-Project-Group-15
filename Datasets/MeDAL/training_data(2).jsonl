{"text": "a kda protein that inhibits phospholipase d pld activity stimulated by adpribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate pip was previously purified from rat brain the sequences of MMP derived from the purified pld inhibitor now identify it as synaptojanin a nerve TP that has been implicated in the endocytosis of fused synaptic vesicles and shown to be a member of the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase family further characterization of the enzymatic properties of synaptojanin now shows that it hydrolyzes only the phosphate from inositol trisphosphate ip and that it does not catalyze the dephosphorylation of either ip or inositol bisphosphate however synaptojanin hydrolyzes both the and phosphates of pip and the phosphate of phosphatidylinositol phosphate converting both EDC to phosphatidylinositol magnesium is required for the hydrolysis of ip but not for that of PIs by synaptojanin the inhibition of pld by synaptojanin is attributable to its ability to hydrolyze pip synaptojanin did not inhibit pld in the absence of pip and the extent of pld inhibition was related to the extent of pip hydrolysis in ATP vesicles it has been proposed that the biosynthesis of pip and the activation of pld by adpribosylation factor constitute a positive loop to increase rapidly the concentrations of pip and phosphatidic acid pa during membrane vesiculation the pa thus produced probably together with pip facilitates vesicle coat assembly the hydrolysis of pip and consequent inhibition of pld by synaptojanin might therefore constitute a mechanism to halt the positive loop connecting pip and pa during the endocytotic cycle of SVs and serve as a signal for uncoating"}

{"text": "in this work different modifications of photocrosslinked PP fumaratepolynvinyl pyrrolidone ppfpnvp matrices were studied for their effect on the PR kinetics of two ophthalmic drugs the hydrophilicity of solid ppfpnvp matrices loaded with acetazolamide az or timolol maleate tm was increased by adding various amounts of PE glycol peg or by increasing the amount of nvinyl pyrrolidone nvp in the polymer mixture prior to crosslinking the in vitro release studies that utilized highperformance liquid chromatography for quantification revealed highly accelerated drug PR from the matrices with increasing contents of the hydrophilic modifier az was released from matrices containing peg in days which equals approximately of the PR period found for the unmodified matrices a comparable acceleration in drug PR was found for tmloaded samples modified with peg these studies further revealed that peg is sufficient to shorten the tm release duration by onethird a significant acceleration in drug PR was also found for the samples that were fabricated from a ppfnvp mixture with increased nvp content matrix water content and erosion were assessed gravimetrically MCT was used to image structural changes of the release systems and shed light on the drugrelease mechanism this study showed that hydrophilic matrix modifications of ppfpnvp matrices accelerate the drug PR of two ophthalmic drugs and represent a suitable tool to adjust drugrelease rates from ppfbased matrices for different therapeutic needs"}
