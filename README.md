# Speech Recognition and Translation System For Medical Communication

This is our final project for the course *CS 5302 - Speech and Language Processing With Generative AI* offered in Spring 2024 at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. This project was supervised by the course instructor Dr. Agha Ali Raza (Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, LUMS).

## Introduction

Effective communication between patients and healthcare providers is vital for quality care, especially considering the diverse linguistic backgrounds of patients. This diversity poses challenges, potentially leading to adverse outcomes for refugees, immigrants, and those in underserved areas. Our proposed solution is an SMTS (Speech-to-Machine Translation System), integrating speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech technologies to bridge language gaps in healthcare. Development involves database selection, LLM fine-tuning, and RAG pipeline utilization, enabling real-time access to medical advice and information.
