periodontitis refractory to conventional mechanical therapy p.o. administered antimicrobial agents often lead to ecological disturbances in the normal oral and intestinal microflora with overgrowth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms which may spread within the host or from patient to patient causing infections the use of antimicrobial agents also promotes the emergence of bacterial drug resistance both in the periodontal pocket and in the normal oral and intestinal microflora topical administration of antimicrobial agents in the periodontal pockets causes restricted disturbances in the intestinal microflora although there is a substantial risk of development of resistance at the site of application a number of clinical studies imply that correct use of antimicrobial agents might be beneficial for a subset of patients with AD or juvenile periodontitis the choice of antimicrobial agent should always be based on accurate microbial analyses of the subgingival microflora and in
